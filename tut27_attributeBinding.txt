INTRODUCTION TO Attribute Binding

- is a technique that allows the user to bind attributes of elements from component to view(template)

- the data flow is only one-way i.e. from component to view

- can be used for any existing properties or custom attributes

- Syntax: [attr.attribute_name]="'expression'"

- the functionility may seem almost similar to property binding but there is difference 
    - there is difference in syntax
    - some attributes are not natively supported for elements, and they don't work with 'Property Binding', but they do work with 'Attribute Binding'
        - Ex: 'colspan' a attribute of <td> element, don't work with Property Binding, only works with 'Attribute Binding'
