INTRODUCTION TO Two-Way Data Binding
---------------------------------------

- Is a technique that allows the user to bind events of elements from view/template to component and vice-versa

- The data flow is both ways i.e. from view to component and from component to view

- Two-way data binding is a combination of Event binding and Property binding
 
- Two way data binding is a combination of
    -> Property Binding and Event Binding on the same element
    E.g. 
        <input [value]="data1" (input)="$event.target.value" />

- Angular provides a built-in directive called "ngModel"
    - using ngModel - it will handle both Property binding and Event binding

- syntax: <input [(ngModel)]='variable_name' />
    - syntax of ngModel is called the Banana syntax
    - the name of the ngModel i.e. variable_name should be declared in the component class
        - if you don't declare this variable it will give you error
            - error -> property does not exist on AppComponent

- There is one very very important error 
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    "Can't bind to ngModel since it isn't a known property of input"
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    - Why this error ?
        - you have not imported FormsModule in AppModule
    - How to fix it ?
        - Import FormsModule in AppModule
