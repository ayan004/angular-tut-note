Templates in Angular Components

1. Whenever we generate a component
    - 4 files
        - template file ( .html )
        - style.css ( stylesheet )
        - class ( component.ts file )
        - spec ( unit test file )

2. This is totally baased on the choice at installing Angular Apps
    - if you selected scss
    - if you selected css
        style.css

3. Decorator - It gives definition and meaning of that component    
    Prefix for decorator - @

4. By default Angular will add "app" as prefix in the selector
    - selector -> is the unique identifer to identify the component
    - Name of the selector for the default component <app.component> -> <app-root>

    -> Can you change the default "app" prefix?
        -> YES - we can change it throughout the app
        -> what will happen if I change? - you have to update the change everywhere, where you have used it
        -> will your app work or will it crash? - if you have updated with your latest prefix, then it will work

5. Templates in Components

    - Two ways of using templates in Components
        - templateUrl
            - link the html file
            - is always 1 single html file
        - template  
            - will pass the HTML code right there within bapticks( ` ) and not single quotes

6. stylesURL
    -> is an array
    -> it can take multiple stylesheets as input
