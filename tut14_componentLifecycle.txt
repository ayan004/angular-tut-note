Angular Component Lifecycle Hooks::

There are 8 Lifecycle Hooks

    - ngOnChanges()
    - ngOnInit()
    - ngDoCheck()
    - ngAfterContentInit()
    - ngAfterContentChecked()
    - ngAfterViewInit()
    - ngAfterViewChecked()
    - ngOnDestroy()


-> ngOnChanges()
    - Used in pretty much any component that has an input
    - Called whenever an input value changes
    - Is called the first time before ngOnInit

-> ngOnInit()
    - Used to initialize data in a component
    - Called after input values are set when a component is initialized
    - Added to every component by default by the AngularCLI
    - Called only once

-> ngDoCheck()
    - Called during all change detection runs
    - A run through the view by Angular to update/detect changes

->  ngAfterContentInit()
    - Called only once after first ngDoCheck() 
    - Called after the first run through of initializing content

-> ngAfterContentChecked()
    - Called after every ngDoCheck()
    - Waits till after ngAfterContentInit() on first run through

-> ngAfterViewInit()
    - Called after Angular initializes component and child component content
    - Called only once after view is initialized

-> ngAfterViewChecked()
    - Called after all the content is initialized and checked (component and child components)
    - First call is after ngAfterViewInit()
    - Called after every ngAfterContentChecked() call is completed

-> ngOnDestroy()
    - Used to clean up any necessary code when a component is removed from the DOM
    - Fairly often used to unsubscribe from things like services
    - Called only once just before component is removed from the DOM



Some of the most used ones are:
- ngOnChanges()
- ngOnInit()
- ngAfterViewInit()
- ngOnDestroy()

Some more points on Lifecycle Hooks

1. By default we have ngOnInit

2. Whichever lifecycle hooks we want to use
    a. import it ( e.g. OnInit )
    b. implement the interface ( e.g. OnInit )
    c. implement the method ( e.g. ngOnInit(): void {} )

3. We can have any number of lifecycle hooks implemented
