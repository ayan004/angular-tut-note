INTRODUCTION TO Property Binding

- is a technique that allows the user to bind properties of elements from component to view(template)

- the data flow is only one-way i.e. from component to view 

- can be used for all properties like title, placeholder, innerHTML, src, etc

- we can bind multiple properties to an element

- you can almost bind most of the properties of HTML elements

- Syntax: [property]= "'expression'"

- from the tutorial I learned only the below ones
    - innerHTML
    - src
    - alt
    - title
    - Go to w3schools.com -> HTML tutorial -> property HTML elements -> you will get the list of all properties
