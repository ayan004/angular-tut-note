1. Angular is a modulaar based architecture

    - There are lot of modules which are built-in
    - Examples
        - BrowserModule
        - BrowserAnimationsModule

    - Angular Material Library
        - MatButtonModule
        - MatDropDownModule

2. All the code and functionality is grouped in a modules

3. Whenever you see a @ symbol - it's a decorator

4. What modules consist
    - declarations
        - this is where we will add all the components of the modules
    - imports
        - we can import modules inside a module
    - providers
        - services that we need will be injected here
    - bootstrap
        - what is the first component, the module should load
    - exports
        - is to export and expose the component outside of the module

5. Every Angular application should have atleast 1 module

6. By default, the Angular framework provides us with AppModule

7. The AppModule will have a component by the name
    - AppComponent

8. Whenever we are building Angular applications
    - we will always think of Modules first

        Contacts
        Users
        Leads
        Opportunities
