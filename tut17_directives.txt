Q. What is an Angular Directive?

- Angular directives are used to extend the power of the HTML by giving it new syntax.
- Directives can extend, change or modify behaviour of the DOM elements

There are 3 types of Directives:

- Component Directives  
    - Every Angular application must have at least 1 Component
    - Have its own templates
    - Events attached

- Stuctural Directives  
    - Updates structure of the view
    - ngFor, ngIf and ngSwitch

- Attributes Directives
    - ngStyle, ngClass

How to generate directives
    - ng generate component <component_name>  
    [Here, in the video it is told that component is also a directive, right now I don't know how it is]
    - ng generate directive <directive_name>
