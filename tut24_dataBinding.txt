INTRODUCTION TO DATA BINDING

- Means to bind the data from view(Template) to Controller(Component class) and vice versa

- Data binding as the name suggest - interacting with data

- Defines how the data flows and how the data gets updated based on business logic

- Each component consists of
    users.component.html -> view/HTML/UI
    users.component.scss -> stylesheet
    users.component.ts -> logic and expressions
    users.component.spec.ts

    Data is spread throughout these files - so data binding helps in interacting with data of the component

- There are two types of data binding 
    - One-way data binding
    - Two-way data binding

- One way data binding  
    - Component to view
        - interpolation
        - property binding
        - style binding
        - attribute binding
    - View to component
        - Event Binding (This Event binding may be under 'view to component', because data is originating from DOM/view and going to the controller)

- Two-way Data Binding
    - Data flows from view to component and back to component from the view
