What are Structural Directives?

- Structural directives are responsible for HTML layout. They shape or reshape the DOM's structure, typically by adding, removing or manipulating elements.

- As with other directives, you apply a structural directive to a host element. The directive then does whatever it's supposed to do with the host element and its descendents.

- Structural directives are easy to recognize. An asterisk (*) precedes the directive attribute name as in this example.
E.g. ngIf
    <div *ngIf="<condition>"> Value 1 </div>

- Types of Structural Directives:
    - ngIf
    - ngFor
    - ngSwitch
