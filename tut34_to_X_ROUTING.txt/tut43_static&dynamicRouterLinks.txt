STATIC & DYNAMIC Router Links
-------------------------------

- When applied to an element in a template, makes that element a link that initiates navigation to a route

- Navigation opens one or more routed components in one or more <router-outlet> locations on the page

- We can have any number of router links in the template

- Router links can be static or can be dynamic in nature

- Static router link  
    - E.g.
       <a [routerLink]="'/edit'"> Edit </a>

- Dynamic router link 
    - E.g.
       <a [routerLink]="['/user', client.clientId, 'edit']"> Edit </a>
    - We do not have to put "/" in variables in routerLink
