INTRODUCTION TO Angular Router <tut 34>
-------------------------------

- Routing is a mechanism used by Angular framework to manage the "paths" and routes of our Angular applications

- Routing strategy helps in navigation between various views in our Angular application 

- Angular framework comes with "Router" module which has everything we need to design, develop and implement routes and navigation links

- Router is a singleton - which means there is ONLY one instance of the router in our Angular application

- Angular Router is the official Router module which is written and maintained by core Angular team  

- The router module is found in the package @angular/router

- We need to setup Router array - every time a request is made, the router will search in the list of array and find the most relevant match

- Router has states- which helps us get important information about the current state and data related to routes

- All batteries included for router[don't know the meaning of this line]

- We can handle various types of routes in Angular app
    - Routes for components
    - Getting Query Params from routes
    - Getting the URL segments
    - Loading child routes for a module
    - Lazy Loading
    - Handling wild card routes
    - Handling default routes
    - Handling 404 route

- Examples:

    Home -> http://myapplication.com/ -> Default module
    Profile -> http://myapplication.com/profile -> Component Routing
    Search -> http://myapplication.com/search?user=abc -> Query Params
    Tasks -> http://myapplication.com/task/10/category/pending -> URL segment
    Users -> http://myapplication.com/users -> module
    view-user -> http://myaapplication.com/users/view/10 -> child routes
    edit-user -> http://myapplication.com/users/edit/10 -> child routes
    add-user -> http://myapplication.com/users/add -> child routes
    manage-user -> http://myapplication.com/users/manage -> child routes
    pageNotFound -> http://myapplication.com/pageNotFound -> 404 error -> No matching routes


BRIEFING ON Component Routes  <tut 35>
---------------------------------

- Each component can have its own Routes

- Various examples of component routes are:
    - /products
    - /products/view
    - /products/add
    - /users


BRIEFING ON Router Outlet    <tut 36>
----------------------------------------
- Router outlet is a built-in-directive

- Every Angular app should have "atleast" 1 router outlet   
    - primary router outlet

- By default - the router outlet is defined in app.component.html file

- The Router inserts the component inside the <router-outlet> that gets matched based on the current browser's URL

- You can have multiple router outlets in your application


BRIEFING ON Multiple Router Outlet    <tut 37>
--------------------------------------------------
- The Router-outlet is a directive that's available from the router library where the Router inserts the component that gets matched based on the current browser's URL

- You can add multiple outlets in your Angular application which enables you to implement avanced routing scenarios

- By default - there is always a router-outlet and its treated as "primary"

- We need to define named router outlets

- When we don't provide any name for router-outlet it becomes primary

- We can give any name we want - try to give meaningful names 

- Example of declaring multiple router outlets
{
    path: 'add',
    component: AddLoansComponent,
    outlet: 'route1'
}

- http://localhost:4200/loans(route1:add)       ['loans' is also a path that is declared, same as the 'add' path, but it is not mentioned here]

- http://localhost:4200/(route1:add)   [this URL is without 'loans']



BRIEFING ON Routing Strategy    <tut 38>
-------------------------------------------
- Routing behaviour of the application URLs

- Angular provides two routing strategies
    - PathLocationStrategy
        - Default routing strategy for Angular apps
        - HTML 5 push state URL
        - Examples
            - http://myapp.com/dashboard
            - http://myapp.com/user/10
            - http://myapp.com/user/10/photos
            - http://myapp.com/search?query=abc&state=ka&city=bengaluru
    - HashLocationStrategy
        - URL segments/patterns
        - URL will have hash in the URLs
        - Examples
            - http://myapp.com/#/dashboard
            - http://myapp.com/#/user/10
            - http://myapp.com/#/user/10/photos
            - http://myapp.com/#/search?query=abc&state=ka&city=bengaluru
         - How to use HashLocationStrategy?
            - We need to import HashLocationStrategy, LocationStrategy from @angular/common
            - Add it to Providers array
            - Angular will start loading our URLs using #

- Why do we need two different types of routing?
    Angular is a SPA(single page app)
        - index.html
    Cloud Vendors
        - AWS 
        - GCP
        - Azure
        - Hosting Provider(Bluehost, Siteground, DigitalOcean)
    /#/loans/add -> route
    - The route with '#' helps to understand that 'add' is not a different folder, its just a route

-  Which one you should use when?
    - Really there is no difference that will affect your application
    - PathLocationStrategy is preferred because
        - Clean URLs
        - Simple
        - Bookmarkable
        - Easy to remember
