ROUTING - ROUTE GUARDS
----------------------------

- Use route guards to prevent users from navigating to parts of an app without authorization

- Route guards are used to secure the route paths

- In most cases, the routes and screens are protected behind a good authenticaton system

- We can generate any number of guards based on our application requirements 

- The route guard resolves to true or false based on custom logic and functionality

- E.g. 

    user -> Route guard                         
            -> Custom logic
                -> True                         
                    -> can access the route  

                -> false
                    -> custom logic on failure condition

- To generate the route guard we can make use of Anguar CLI
    - ng generate guard <guard_name>

- Inject the guard in our module under providers

- There are various types of route guards available, they are called interfaces
    - canActivate: checks to see if a user can visit a route
    - canActivateChild: checks to see if a user can visit a routes children
    - canLoad: checks to see if a user can route to a module that lazy loaded
    - canDeactivate: checks to see if a user can exit a route
    - resolve: performs route data retrieval before route activation 

- We can implement more than 1 guards in our application
