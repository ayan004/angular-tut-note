ROUTING - Wildcard Routes
---------------------------

- Wild card intercepts any invalid URLs in our application 

- When no matching routes are found in the routes array, the router does not know where to go and hence results in console errors

- Wild card routes are defined in the routes array using
    - { path: '**' }

- Usually a component named PageNotFound is mapped as best practice

- This is to be the last route in the 'route' configuration
