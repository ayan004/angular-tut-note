Redirecting Routes (with pathMatch)
-------------------------------------

- When we want a route to be redirected to another route - we will implement the redirectTo in our routes array

- The syntax to define the same is given below 
    - {path: ", redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch: 'full'}

- The empty path indicates that it's the default root of the application

- The empty path also requires us to mention that pathMatch should be "full"

- Ex:
    {
        path: '', 
        redirectTo: 'leads-listing', 
        pathMatch: 'full' 
    },
    { 
        path: 'leads-listing', 
        component: LeadsListingComponent 
    }
