LAZY LOADING
--------------

- Any angular application is made up of multiple modules

- Lets assume the modules of a 'Loan Managment System'
    - Loans
    - Customers
    - Payments
    - Invoices
    - Reports
    - Authentication
    - Authorization
    - Downloads
    - Admin

- Angular by default will load all modules at start

- Loading all modules initially - weather required or not 
    - makes your application performance slow
    - also its a bad idea to expose modules which user is not going to use   

- Lazy loading comes into picture
    - Lazy loadig helps keep initial bundle sizes smaller, which in turn helps decrease load times
    - Initially will load only modules which are mandatory
    - Rest will be served as requested
    - We have to route for each module
    - Lets assume we are creating route to the 'Payments' module
        /payments
        - when URL will have the above path mentioned, then only we will load this module 
    - it will boast app performance
    - respond will be better
    - we can verify if the user has access to this module
    - Loading the modules on-demand (we can verify them in the console)

- If you are coming from previous version of Angular 8
    - the syntax has changed
        - please use the expects function

- There are two steps to create a lazy loading feature module
    - Create Feature Module
    - Configure loadChildren in appRouting

- Feature module is a module specific to certain functionality

- To load a feature module lazily (only on demand) we need to load its children using the loadChildren property in route configuraton

- The modules generated using the Angular CLI - for lazy loading
    -> there will be NO entry in AppModule
    -> Hence, it will not be loaded initially

- Syntax to create the lazy loading is given below
    - ng g module <module_name> --route <module_route> --module app.module
    - ng g module customers --route customers --module app.module

- The above command will generate the following
    - A routing file for the module
    - A module file
    - A component
        - html
        - css/scss
        - spec
        - class
    - UPDATE the app routing module

- /payments
    ->
