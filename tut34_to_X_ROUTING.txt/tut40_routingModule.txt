INTRODUCTION TO Routing Module
--------------------------------

- Routing module is a placeholder for configuring all routes and navigations in one module

- Each module can have its own routes

- Best practice is to have all routes configured in one place
    - Because its easy to maintain and debug

- Duing the Angular app installation, we get an option
    - Do you want to have routing in your application?
        - It will automatically create the app routing module for us 

- Before Angular 9 or Angular 10, we have to install this routing module manually

- We can generate the APP ROUTING MODULE using the CLI
    - ng generate module app-routing --flat --module=app 


AFTER GENERATING THE 'app-routing.module.ts' MANUALLY WE NEED TO DO THE FOLLOWING STEPS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- We need to import modules from the package
    - import {Routes, RouterModule} from '@angular/router';

- We need to configure route path array in the file
    - const routes: Routes = [];

- Then we need to define our module
    - @NgModule({
        imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
        exports: [RouterModule]
    })

- We need to export the module
    - export class AppRoutingModule{}

- Import the 'app-routing.module.ts' module in the 'app.module.ts'
