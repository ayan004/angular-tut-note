INTRODUCTION TO Base Href
----------------------------

- Base HREF is mandatory for all Angular apps

- Base HREF is present in your index.html file

- The project is pointing to the "root" directory/folder of your server which is running at 4200 port

- When you are deploying your Angular apps to server, you have to mention the root folder from where the execution will start
    -> http://myapp.com/app1/  - this can be the root folder
    -> http://myapp.com  - this can be the root folder
    -> So base HREF mentions from where to start the execution

- It decides where you want to deploy your app
    - thats why its extremely important

- Wrong configuration leads to pointing to wrong folder route path

- Setting the base href using the command line --base-href=  [this syntax may vary]

- Syntax: <base href="/">
